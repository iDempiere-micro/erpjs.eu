subtitle: Why we are building ERP&CRM for the cloud in TypeScript 
---

The [erpjs](http://erpjs.eu) team has always been building CRM and ERP solutions for clients in different industries - hospitality, finance, utility... you name it.
With the rise of the cloud, open source and JavaScript/TypeScript we were really keen to see ERP or CRM that would run in the cloud natively (e.g. in Amazon Lambda, Azure Functions or IBM Cloud Functions) so you would not need the whole IT infrastructure (an administrator, servers etc.), where you would really pay just for using the cloud; that would be open-source so there would be no vendor lock-in and you would be free to switch between partners if needed; that would be written in JavaScript or TypeScript so there would be enough developers available on the market to work on the solutions.
To our surprise we have not find such a solution for quite long so we decided to build one by ourselves.
